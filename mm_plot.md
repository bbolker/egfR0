Since our last meeting, WZ and I have:

* tried to make the pictures easier to read
* changed the cut algorithm to not cut until a local minimum is reached; this seems to just fix Kanagawa
* made a pipeline that should make it relatively easy to compare different parameter choices (see links below)

Questions:

* The first window in Kanagawa has a double peak; JD feels like we should not fiddle
* We kind of want to exclude Perak; we could do that by raising the minimum to 16, or just by making a judgment that we hate it
* Tokyo1 has two double peaks!
* What do we think about the first peak in Tokyo2?
