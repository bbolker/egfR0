Modularize windowning parameters

Think about a min climb ratio as well as a minimum time ratio to define an outbreak

Don't break phases while we're still falling

Alphabetize the goddam time series!

Make a list of things we excluded 

The current Serengeti/Ngorongoro series seems very limited; why did we stop?

Current Serengeti seems like one phase to Katie â€“ how does that inform our decisions about other time series?

Write down all criteria explicitly

Should a single 0 observation be a break point?

Discussion: the fitting machine itself should consider uncertainty in window selection!

Look at conflicted package (assign to Roswell)
