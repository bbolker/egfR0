Modularize windowing parameters…

Make a list of things we excluded 

The current Serengeti/Ngorongoro series seems very limited; why did we stop?

Current Serengeti seems like one phase to Katie – how does that inform our decisions about other time series?

Write down all criteria explicitly

Should a single 0 observation be a break point?
* Harder to implement

Discussion: the fitting machine itself should consider uncertainty in window selection!
* Will not implement for this project

Look at conflicted package (assign to Roswell)
